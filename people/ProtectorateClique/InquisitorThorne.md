details:
  - "**Spitalian Recruit, Pollen**"
  - "**Chosen**: A prophecy foretold your rise, but a close friend doubts your destiny and stands in your way. You wear a **prophetic amulet** marking your supposed fate."
  - "**Potential**: Preservists are relentless, never giving their enemies a chance to surrender. Trained in a brutal technique known as Preservalis, they strike with their sword to create an opening, then follow up with a point-blank pistol shot to ensure the kill. The recoil propels them out of reach, leaving their foes defenceless. _You disengage after attacking._"
