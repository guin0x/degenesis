- Deep knowledge of dark rituals and spore-related powers.
- Cunning and strategic, often advising [Kargan](Kargan.md) on matters of magic and warfare.
- Unpredictable and feared even by her own clan.
- Struggling to control the volatile powers she taps into.
- Speaks in whispers and riddles, often surrounded by strange, glowing spores.
- Carries a staff made of twisted metal, with spore-infested bones embedded in it.
