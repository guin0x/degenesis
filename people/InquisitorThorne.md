Spitalian
**CHOSEN**: A prophecy foretold your rise, but a close friend doubts your destiny and stands in your way. You wear a **prophetic amulet** marking your supposed fate.

STR 8
DEX 13
WIL 13

HP 1

Skills
- Faith
- Expression  
- Leadership
- Stamina

Potential
- Preservists are relentless, never giving their enemies a chance to surrender. Trained in a brutal technique known as Preservalis, they strike with their sword to create an opening, then follow up with a point-blank pistol shot to ensure the kill. The recoil propels them out of reach, leaving their foes defenceless. _You disengage after attacking._

- Scalpel (d6)
- Field Journal
- Sterile Gloves
- **The Manual**
- **Mask** (1 Armour against Spore Infestation).
