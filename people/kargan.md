- Strength: Unmatched in combat, a tactical genius.
- Virtue: Fiercely loyal to his clan, willing to do anything for their dominance.
- Flaw: Overly aggressive, often pushing his people into unnecessary conflicts.
- Problem: Facing increased resistance from the [Vorstok](../factions/Vorstok.md) Kin and the encroaching spore fields.
- Aspect: Speaks with a booming voice, exuding confidence and intimidation.
