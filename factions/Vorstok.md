| Location            | Approximately 600 km east of the ruins of Kiev.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Environment         | Tundra (and Taiga in the south), now increasingly encroached upon by spore fields from the east                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| History             | The Vostok Kin trace their lineage back to survivors who fled eastward during the early days of the Eschaton. Initially, they found refuge in the dense forests and open steppes, where they developed a semi-nomadic lifestyle centred around hunting, foraging, and small-scale agriculture.                       |
| Culture             | The Vostok Kin are a deeply spiritual people with a rich oral tradition. They believe their ancestors were guided by the spirits of the land to their current home, and they have a strong connection to nature. Their society is organised around extended family units, with elders holding significant influence. |
| Spirituality        | They worship a pantheon of nature spirits, each associated with different aspects of their environment, such as whispers, weather and animals.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Rites of Passage    | Important milestones in a Vostok Kin's life are marked by elaborate ceremonies that often involve tests of skill and endurance. Includes the Rite of the Transcend Spore, when **Primer** Spores are consumed ritualistically.                                                                                       |
| Conflict Resolution | Disputes are settled through council meetings where elders mediate and seek the wisdom of the spirits.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
