- Culture: The Ironclaw Horde values strength, aggression, and dominance. Their society is built on the idea that only the strong survive, and their leaders are chosen based on combat prowess and ruthlessness.
- Warrior Code: They follow a strict code that glorifies combat and valour in battle. Warriors earn their status through feats of strength and brutality.
- Rites of Passage: Young members are subjected to brutal trials to prove their worth. Only those who survive and excel are fully accepted into the clan.
- Conflict Resolution: Disputes are often settled through duels or battles, with the winner gaining authority.
