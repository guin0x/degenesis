# To Kiev South

> East Pollen, 2793 AD

The hunter-gatherer clan known as the [Vorstok](factions/Vorstok.md) Kin is deeply connected to your land and traditions. Over the past decade, the relentless advance of the spore fields from the east of [Pollen](https://degenesis.com/world/cultures/pollen) has placed their ancestral homeland in grave danger.

The once plentiful taiga and tundra have become battlegrounds, threatened not only by the deadly spores but also by the encroaching [Ironclaw](../../factions/ironclaw.md) Horde, led by the fearsome warlord [Kargan](../../people/kargan.md), the Bloodthirsty.

The Lesnje, the whispering guardians of the woods, have grown increasingly aggressive, tipping the natural balance into chaos.

Following a brutal Ironclaw raid that resulted in the abduction of five Vostok women, Elder [Mirova](../../people/mirova.md) calls for a council. The clanâ€™s shamans, led by [Yelena](../../people/yelena.md), the Seer, have had disturbing visions of a cataclysmic future. The council places its hope in a perilous journey to find a new homeland. Rumours speak of a valley south of the ruins of Kiev where the taiga is strong and rivers are clean. [Scouts](../../people/VostokScouts/index.md) have been chosen for this endeavour, tasked with mapping the path to this promised land, seeking alliances with other clans and tribes along the way.
