# {{ page.title }}

The hunter-gatherer clan known as the [Vostok](../../people/Vostok/index.md) Kin is deeply connected to your land and traditions. Over the past decade, the relentless advance of the spore fields from the east of [Pollen](https://degenesis.com/world/cultures/pollen) has placed their ancestral homeland in grave danger.

The once plentiful taiga and tundra have become battlegrounds, threatened not only by the deadly spores but also by the encroaching Irowclaw Horde, led by the fearsome warlord Kargan, the Bloodthirsty.

The Lesnje, the whispering guardians of the woods, have grown increasingly aggressive, tipping the natural balance into chaos.

Following a brutal Ironclaw raid that resulted in the abduction of five Vostok women, Elder [Mirova](../../people/Vostok/mirova.md) calls for a council. The clanâ€™s shamans, led by [Yelena](../../people/Vostok/yelena.md), the Seer, have had disturbing visions of a cataclysmic future. The council places its hope in a perilous journey to find a new homeland. Rumours speak of a valley south of the ruins of Kiev where the taiga is strong and rivers are clean. [Scouts](../../people/Vostok/index.md) have been chosen for this endeavour, tasked with mapping the path to this promised land, seeking alliances with other clans and tribes along the way.
