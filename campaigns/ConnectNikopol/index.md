- "**Spitalian Expedition Concern**: A Spitalian platoon based in Nikopol for Biokinetic hunts is rumoured to have suffered near-total losses. The Consultant of Danzig is seeking anyone willing to confirm the expedition's status, as northern Spitalians hope these reports are exaggerated or untrue."
- "**Mission Rewards and Passage**: Any retrieval of equipment, notes, specimens, or personnel will be rewarded. Clanners arranged safe passage to Nikopol via a Storski train, but a return trip hinges on delivering results to the Spitalian contingent in Danzig."
