## What is your potential? Roll 1d6.

#### 1: Splaying

> The Spitalian expertly manoeuvres the Splayer, sliding the blades open and closed with precise, deadly efficiency. With a swift motion, he strikes, forcing the mechanism to snap open, and prepares for another strike, each movement adding to his defence and control of battlefield.

*Requires a **Splayer**. Engaged opponent have their next attacks impaired. Your attacks are impaired (d4) but they have the Blast property.*

#### 2: Phalanx

> A wall of spears forms a nearly impenetrable defence, with each point aimed at the enemy. Standing shoulder to shoulder, the Spitalian joins the line, ready to draw attacks toward himself to protect his comrades. As the phalanx strengthens, any foe foolish enough to charge risks impaling themselves on their deadly formation.

*Requires 2+ close allies. Your opponent is impaired if they try to attack the formation.*

#### 3: Preservalis

> Preservists are relentless, never giving their enemies a chance to surrender. Trained in a brutal technique known as Preservalis, they strike with their sword to create an opening, then follow up with a point-blank pistol shot to ensure the kill. The recoil propels them out of reach, leaving their foes defenceless.

*Requires dual wielding a **Sword** and a **Pistol**. When you roll 6+ damage you may disengage after attacking.*

#### 4: Last Bastion

> The Spitalian's knowledge of his enemy runs deep—flesh torn, bones exposed, even the most hidden vulnerabilities laid bare. He knows precisely where to strike and how to inflict maximum pain. When facing Psychonauts, this intimate understanding grants him an edge, allowing him to strike with devastating accuracy.

*Gain **Fatigue**. Your attacks against Psychonaults ignores armour.*

#### 5: Kranzler's Teachings

> Kranzler's soul is unyielding, impervious even to the eerie chants of the Dushani. Famulancers study his techniques, but only the most dedicated can truly master them. Those who succeed become temporarily immune to Psychonautic mental influences, standing firm when others would falter.

*Gain **Fatigue**. You are immune to Dushani chants.*

#### 6: The Last Farewell

> The battlefield is littered with the fallen, and the Spitalian stands alone, the last beacon of hope. In this desperate hour, a destructive madness fuels him, his humanity burning away as he fights on. For a brief time, his attacks, defences, and resilience surge with unmatched fury, but if an ally stirs and rejoins the fight, the flame of his rage extinguishes.

*Your attacks are enhanced until someone rejoins the fight.*
