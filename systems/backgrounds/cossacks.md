| ![05-CULT-CLANNERS-WHITE-ON-BLACK-320x320](../../imgs/icons/05-CULT-CLANNERS-WHITE-ON-BLACK-320x320.webp) | The steppe is wide, brutal, and unforgiving—but so are the Cossacks. Out here, where the wind howls like a wounded beast and the horizon stretches endlessly, they reign supreme, born of a land that knows no mercy. The Cossacks don’t just survive—they thrive, their blood thick with the cold steel of defiance and their hearts bound to the untamed wilderness. |

## What is your potential? Roll 1d6.

#### 1: Elephant Skin

> Sandstorms and cold winds have carved their marks into your skin. Flesh has torn a hundred times, scabbing over into tough, knotted scars. It isn’t pretty, but it’s hard as hell to cut through.

*Gain +1 Armour (to the limit of 3).*

#### 2: Asceticism 

> Lichen, beetles, leather strips—none of it matters. Hunger gnaws, but it never consumes you. Dew from stones is a feast. Anything edible, no matter how foul, is swallowed down without a second thought.

*You don't become deprived due to lack of water or food.*

#### 3: Ether Call

> Beyond the limits of sound, beyond the world of flesh and bone, the ether hums. Chakras resonate in its currents, and brain waves flutter like distant echoes. The spore-infested open the gate to this unseen world, where emotions ripple through the ether, intoxicating those who know how to listen.

*While suffering from Sepsis Infestation, you can feel the presence of other spore-infested people and Psychonaults.*

#### 4: Marathon

> Keep going. One step after another. The body is a machine—muscle, bone, and will—and this machine doesn’t stop. It never tires, it never falters. One destination, one purpose. Forward.

*You are able to travel twice as much per day.*

#### 5: Sleek

> The crowd cheers, thinking it’s just a show—his body bending, joints popping in ways that make them wince. But this isn’t just entertainment. These contortions were learned in darker places, for darker purposes.

*You can always evade a grapple, being stuck, bound or chained.*

#### 6: Could be Worse

> Bruises fade, cuts close, and bones mend. Pain is a warning, not a weakness. The character feels it, acknowledges it—but never lets it stop them. Pain exists to protect, not to prevent survival.

*You always succeed on STR saves against Critical Damage.*
