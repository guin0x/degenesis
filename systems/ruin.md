# Sepsis

When you are exposed to the primer, or take [Burn](https://degenesis.com/world/stories/apocalyptics/burn-baby-burn), you suffer [Spore Infestation](https://degenesis.com/world/stories/pollen/sepsis).
Environment suits and masks reduce the impact of Spore Infestation.
Spore Infestation reduces **HP**.

If reduced to exactly **0 HP**, a culture stigma blooms.
This stigma changes slowly over time, and goes away in a month.

If Spore Infestation goes beyond **0 HP**, you lose WIL and must pass a WIL save.
If you fail, you take Sepsis which takes a **Burden** slot.
With Sepsis, you develop a random mutation (roll on the table below).

| **1**   | Light sporination close to spore field                              |
| **d4**  | Spore mist in hi-risk zones                                         |
| **d6**  | Strong sporination in adult spore field                             |
| **d8**  | Fungal bloom in adult spore field                                   |
| **d10** | Fungal bloom in Mother spore field                                  |
| **d12** | Spore saturation at the Pollen spore front and in the Earth Chakras |

#### Note

The amount and frequency of how you deal Primer infection establishes the tone and pacing of your game.
It is a dial to control the amount of Primer your players encounter and how likely they are to change as a result.

## Types of Burn

Different types of Burn are harvested depending on Earth Chakra proximity.
Burn can be of two potencies.
Weak Burn deals **1** Spore Infestation and its effect lasts for one scene.
Potent Burn deals **d6** Spore Infestation and its effect lasts for one hour.

| **BION** | Pollen brings cold and hunger, while **Bion** offers warmth and comfort. One deep breath from the goat skin connects the person to the land, revitalising them with cold winds and minimal sustenance as their body fills with life force. | The Burner shakes off illness and poison, feels no cold. |
