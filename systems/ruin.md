# Ruin

If you are exposed to the primer, or take **Burn**, you suffer Primer infection.

Note:
The amount and frequency of how you deal Primer infection establishes the tone and pacing of your game.
It is a dial to control the amount of Primer your players encounter and how likely they are to change as a result.

|         |           |
| ------- | --------- |
| **d4**  | Glimpse   |
| **d6**  | Contact   |
| **d8**  | Ingestion |
| **d10** | Incision  |
| **d12** | Engulfed  |

Infection damage reduces your HP.
If reduced to exactly 0 HP, you get a mutation and stigmata, roll on random mutation table.
If reduced beyond 0 HP, you lose DEX.
Specifically, if ingested, allows you to temporarily re-roll **2d6+6** for STR or WILL (your choice).
The effect lasts until the end of the scene.
