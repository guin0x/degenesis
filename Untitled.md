My suggestions for cyberpunk inspiration: **DON'T OVERLOOK THE 'PUNK'.**

&#x200B;

1. Watch Penelope Spheeris' *Suburbia*.
2. Read William Gibson's anthology "Burning Chrome", especially the eponymous story (it's the last in the book), "Johnny Mnemonic", "New Rose Hotel", and "The Winter Market". When you're done, *read "Burning Chrome"* ***again***, and look for the things in it that *aren't* science fiction. Get *that* vibe.
3. Listen to as much late 70s punk, 70s/80s New Wave, and modern synthwave/retrowave/outrun/nu-electro/etc as you can.
4. I shouldn't have to recommend stuff like *Blade Runner, RoboCop, Max Headroom, Neuromancer, Count Zero,* and *Mona Lisa Overdrive* by now, but in case you're not an old hand at this, I'm gonna recommend all of that.
5. Also watch Walter Hill's films *The Warriors* and *Streets of Fire*. No, neither is strictly cyberpunk or even SF, but those two flicks ***drip*** with style and 'tude. Avoid the "Director's Cut" of *The Warriors*, though. Trust me.
6. Load up on old noir movies and stories about betrayal, broken dreams, hard times, moral quandaries, desperation, and hopelessness. Cyberpunk is, in a very real sense, 1980s neo(n)-noir with personal technology and rampant capitalism all over it; ignoring that turns a nuanced and textured genre into just "Badassatron 9000 Shoots All The Bullets".
7. Watch Penelope Spheeris' *Suburbia*, AGAIN.

Seriously, running a cyberpunk game and focusing only on the guns and the cyberware and the chrome and the violence is like owning a Lamborghini and only driving it to the store to pick up some beans. The guns and the cyberware and the chrome and the violence are cool, and definitely part of the draw, but there's SOOOOOOOO much else in that genre that you'd otherwise be leaving on the table - and, in a sense, cheating yourself out of.
