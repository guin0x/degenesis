flavour:
- The true rulers of [Pollen](https://degenesis.com/world/cultures/pollen) are the Biokinetics.
- These Aberrants exhibit incredible shape-shifting abilities and display physical prowess that blurs the line with the supernatural.
- The most common forms are Migrants, Biokinetics breaking out across the plains to seed new spore fields and spread the Sepsis westwards, thus expanding their Chakraâ€™s area of influence.
