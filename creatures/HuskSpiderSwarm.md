bullets:
  - The stench of ammonia lingers, accompanied by faint, greasy traces left by their skittering legs.
  - "**Critical Damage**: Cocoons threats in silk that hardens, suffocating the target under layers of interwoven fibers (d4 infection per round)."
  - "**Chakra Calls**: Swarm when spore fields or Psychonauts feel threatened."
  - Nearby clicking and rustling sounds grow louder as Husk Spiders approach.

flavour:
  - Husk Spiders have been seen in the Stukov Desert, sometimes even in Borca.
  - However, their home is Pollen.
  - There, they are the vanguard when the ground thaws and a Fractal Forest comes to the surface.
  - They attack this oasis by the hundreds of thousands, and other spiders and centipedes follow the pheromone contained in their silk.
